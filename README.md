## What is it?

This is a small app to track some stats for members of my trampoline club, displaying some visualisations of their data.

It's also a project for me to practise using the Vue framework.

The app is still under development, so things will be broken for now. Feel free to look around in the meantime, and if you have any suggestions, please open an issue, or contact me through my GitHub account.

You can add new session data which will update the above graph lines.

The top level directory must also contain a file called `db.json` with the following contents:
```
{ "state": {} }
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
