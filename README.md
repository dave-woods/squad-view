# squad-view

## What is it?

This is a small app to track some stats for members of my trampoline club, displaying some visualisations of their data.

It's also a project for me to practise using the Vue framework.

## Main View
![Time of flight view](/rmi/tof.png)

## Project setup
```
npm install
```
The top level directory must also contain a file called `db.json` with the following contents:
```
{ "state": {} }
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm start
```
